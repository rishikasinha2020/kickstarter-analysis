# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

Louise mentioned earlier that she's also interested in Great Britain's theater market, especially musicals. While she's committed to creating a play in the U.S., she's also interested in researching musicals in Great Britain for a future project with an estimated budget of £4,000. To present Louise with the big picture, we will create box plots using statistical computations.

### Purpose
Using the Kickstarter dataset that I have already combed through, I will visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. This is a written report based on my analysis and the visualizations created.

## Analysis and Challenges
Finding 1:
The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. However, January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched. Refer Picture3.png in resources folder.

Finding2:
We have found that while there are only a total of 604 Kickstarter campaigns for plays in Great Britain, the "theater" category is the most successful.

So far, we've visualized all of the campaigns in our Category Statistics sheet. We've discovered trends in the theater category with our Outcomes sheets. (June seems to be a good month to launch a campaign!)

Plays subcategory are most successful category based on outcome. Refer to Picture2.png in resources.

Finding3:
Edinburgh Research suggests that pledge vs Actual donation does not look very good. Refer to Edinburgh Research tab in kickstarter.xls.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May, followed by June, July, august and then april in that order.
Nov, Jan, March and dec months had the most failed kickstarter campaigns in that order. 
Refer to Chart Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png in resources folder for visuals.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Goal range of 1000-4999 had the most successful kickstarter campaign projects. 
Goal range of 45000-49999 had the most failed kickstarer campaign projects.
<1000 and Range between 1000-4999 had the most successful percentage kickstarter campaign projects.
Refer to Chart Outcome vs goals.png under resources folder for visuals.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Failed data for some categories were not in the dataset. When creating formulas they wer throwing error- Went back to the data set to verfy if the errors were legit and confirmed there are actually no failed rows in some categories.

Some values were 0 so when the formulas were trying to use that in calculation it was throwing error. Replaced the error cell will NA or 0 as appropriate.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May, followed by June, July, august and then april in that order.
    Nov, Jan, March and dec months had the most failed kickstarter campaigns in that order. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    Goal range of 1000-4999 had the most successful kickstarter campaign projects. 
    Goal range of 45000-49999 had the most failed kickstarer campaign projects.
    <1000 and Range between 1000-4999 had the most successful percentage kickstarter campaign projects.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    Does not have the data for failed under many categories. Theater is the one category that has rich data.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    Charts for Campaign in different countries/Categories/subcategories.
